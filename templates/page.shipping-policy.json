Once your order is in the shipping process, changes, including address updates, can no longer be made. Please note that we will only ship to the address provided at checkout. We process shipments on business days only, and do not ship on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays. After your order ships, you’ll receive a Shipping Confirmation email. While some items may arrive separately, rest assured, there are no additional shipping charges. For orders with insured shipping, customers are eligible for a replacement if the product is severely damaged and its performance or quality is compromised.</p><h3>Does Satora Dreamer Cat and its associated brands cover the shipping fees for my order?</h3><p>Shipping options and costs will be displayed on the payment page as you proceed to checkout. Depending on the brand, we may offer free worldwide shipping and a paid insured shipping option to give you peace of mind.</p><h3>How do I track my order?</h3><p>All orders come with tracking numbers, which will be emailed to you once your order has been dispatched to the carrier's sorting facility. You can track your order using either the tracking number provided or by entering your Order ID and the email address you used at checkout. Simply visit <a href=\"/pages/baby-order-tracking\" title=\"Track Your Order\">our tracking page</a> to follow your order's progress. Please note that it may take several days for tracking information to appear in the system, depending on the shipping company. If more than 5 business days have passed since your order was placed and no tracking details are available, feel free to contact us for assistance <a href=\"/pages/contact\" title=\"Contact Us\">here</a>.</p><h3>How many days will it take for my order to arrive?</h3><p>Shipping times may vary by location. Below is an estimated timeline for delivery:</p><ul><li><strong>United States</strong>: 7-12 business days </li><li><strong>United Kingdom</strong>: 5-10 business days  </li><li><strong>Europe</strong>: 7-12 business days</li><li><strong>Canada</strong>: 10-14 business days</li><li><strong>Australia</strong>: 7-14 business days</li><li><strong>Mexico, Central America, South America</strong>: 7-12 business days</li><li><strong>Asia</strong>: 5-10 business days  </li></ul><p>Please note that these are estimated delivery times and include our 2-3 day processing period. While we strive to ensure timely deliveries, Satora cannot be held responsible for unforeseen circumstances, such as postal delays, customs procedures, holidays, weather conditions, labor strikes, or any other interruptions that may affect delivery beyond our original estimates.</p><h3>Import Duties and Tax</h3><p>International shipments may be subject to import taxes, duties, and/or customs clearance fees that are charged once the package arrives in the destination country. These fees are the recipient's responsibility, and Satora has no control over them, nor can we estimate the costs. If the shipment is refused and returned, any import taxes and return shipping fees will also be the responsibility of the recipient.</p><p>Since customs policies vary widely from country to country, we recommend contacting your local customs office for more information regarding these charges.</p><h3>Refused to Pay Tax</h3><p>If you refuse to pay tax or it is not paid within certain period, your parcel will be automatically sent back to us. </p><p>The full amount after deducting all shipping costs ($10 + any return shipping cost) will be refunded upon our receipt of the product(s).</p><h3>Lost or Stolen Packages</h3><p>If your package is marked as delivered but you have not received it, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@satora.store\" title=\"mailto:hello@satora.store\">hello@satora.store</a> within three weeks of placing your order. After you report the package as lost, our Customer Service team will collaborate with our shipping partners to initiate an investigation. We will provide a resolution once the investigation is completed.</p><p>Please note that Satora Fat Cat is not responsible for packages delivered to the wrong address if incorrect or incomplete shipping details were provided by the customer. Be sure to verify your address before placing an order as no changes the the shipping address is possible after.</p>"
